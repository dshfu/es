1.Introduction.Longwall Top Coal Caving (LTCC) is an underground mining method developed for thick seam extraction.Depending on the coal seam condition various layouts can be considered for the LTCC.The full seam height LTCC mining layout has been chosen for this work as it takes full advantage of support pressure in fracturing and breaking top coal which increases caveability andLTCC Method Coal,Colliery and Mining ForumAug 29,2018&#0183;&#32;The LTCC Longwall face equipment was designed by a joint Chinese (Yankuang),Australian (Austar Management) and German (DBT) engineering team The equipment was manufactured in Germany and supplied by DBT Technical and Engineering support for the equipment was supplied by DBT Australia,AFC control for LTCC is also,
