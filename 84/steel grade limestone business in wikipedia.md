## Lime for Making Steel Carmeuse
Lime is put to use in primary steelmaking and secondary refining processes.Electric Arc Furnace (EAF) and Basic Oxygen Furnaces (BOF,QBOP,KOBM): Quicklime (dolomitic and high calcium) is used by steelmakers as a flux agent to efficiently and effectively remove impurities such as phosphorus,silica and alumina from scrap melting in the EAF.Crushed Limestone Aggregate by CarmeuseCrushed Limestone Aggregate Made from high quality,natural deposits of limestone,and meeting exacting chemical and physical properties,Carmeuse has a broad range of crushed limestone products that provide highperformance,costeffective,and environmentally friendly attributes and benefits for the construction industry.
