## Manufacture of Lime How to Manufacture Lime using
Lime stones are burnt in either clamps or kilns.1.Clamps: For small quantity of limestone,burning is done in a clamp.On a clear surface about 5 meters in diameter,layers of broken limestones and fuel are laid to form a heap about 4 meters high.Limestone Its Processing and Appliion in Iron andAppliion of limestone and lime in iron and steel plant.During the production of iron by blast furnace (BF) route,limestone is added either in the process of sintering or as a direct feed in the blast furnace.Limestone is normally added during ironmaking for obtaining either neutral or slight basic BF slag.

## Lime kiln Wikipedia
2019115&ensp&#0183&enspThe earliest descriptions of lime kilns differ little from those used for smallscale manufacture a century ago.[citation needed] Because land transportation of minerals like limestone and coal was difficult in the preindustrial era,they were distributed by sea,and lime was most often manufactured at small coastal ports.How does a Lime Kiln Work Professional Manufacturer ofLimestone Calcination Process.To produce quicklime in lime kilns,there are mainly three processes.The first stage is preheating.The second stage is calcining.And the third stage is cooling.In the preheating stage.The feed limestone is preheated by the exhaust hot air from the lime kiln,so that partially of the limestone will be calcined.
