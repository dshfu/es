## How lead is made material,used,processing,product
Lead is a dense,soft,lowmelting metal.It is an important component of batteries,and about 75% of the world's lead production is consumed by the battery industry.Lead is the densest common metal except for gold,and this quality makes it effective in sound barriers and as a shield against Xrays.The World's Biggest Zinc ProducersThe company refined 610,000 tons of zinc in 2017,or about eight percent of global zinc production when including its sister company and subsidiary.The appliions for zinc include autos,galvanized steel,and machine parts.Besides zinc,Korea Zinc is also a major refiner of lead,copper,gold,indium,nickel,bismuth,gallium,and cadmium.

However,lead supply has misfired even more than zinc with the Group now forecasting global refined production to contract by 0.3% this year,compared with an expectation in May that it would grow by 2.5%.The main culprit is Nyrstar's Port Pirie lead smelter in Australia.Global Projection of LeadZinc Supply from Known Resourcesrequire sustainable supply.In order to understand the future availability of lead and zinc,we have projected global supplies on a countrybycountry basis from a detailed global assessment of mineral resources for 2013.The model GeRSDeMo was used to create projections of lead and zinc production from ores,as well as recycling for lead.
