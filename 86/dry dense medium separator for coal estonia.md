## FINAL REPORT IDEFC2605NT42501
For a Utah bituminous coal,the FGX separator provided clean coal ash contents that ranged from a low of 8.57% to a high of 12.48% from a feed coal containing around 17% ash.From the 29 tests involved in the statistically designed test program,the average clean coal ash content was 10.76% while the tailings ash content averaged around 72%.Coal preparation plant WikipediaA coal preparation plant (CPP also known as a coal handling and preparation plant (CHPP),coal handling plant,prep plant,tipple or wash plant) is a facility that washes coal of soil and rock,crushes it into graded sized chunks (sorting),stockpiles grades preparing it for transport to market,and more often than not,also loads coal into rail cars,barges,or ships.

## Dense Medium Separation An Effective and Robust Pre
The chronology of the development of dynamic dense medium separators is depicted in Figure 1.Figure 1 Dynamic Dense Medium Separator Development DMS LABORATORY TESTING To determine if an ore is suitable for preconcentration using DMS (or other gravity separation techniques),a laboratory scale testing program is generally initiated.RECENT DEVELOPMENTS IN PRECONCENTRATION USINGDense media separators are commonly used for preconcentration of coal and diamonds but less commonly for other mineral systems such as lead and zinc.Due to lower head grades adding to the complexities of the ore,multistage dense media separators like the Condor can offer some advantages over the singlestage dense medium cyclones.

Dry Coal Cleaning Dry coal cleaning was popular from 1930 1990.Peak production was 25.4 million tons annually in 1965.Largest allair cleaning plant was 1400 tph in Pennsylvania (1968).Several commercial technologies developed in the period of 1900 1950.Decline was due to the need for efficient low density cuts and environmentalMineral processing WikipediaIndustrially,the most common dense media is a suspension of fine magnetite and or ferrosilicon particles.An aqueous solution as a dense medium is used in coal processing in the form of a belknap wash and suspensions in air are used in waterdeficient areas,like areas of China,where sand is used to separate coal from the gangue minerals.

The air dense medium fluidized bed dry coal separator uses gassolid phases as the dense medium for coal separation,where the solid phase is magnetite powder.When fluidized,the state of the gassolid phases of the bed performs like a fluid,and the heavy and light materials are separated by their densities.There are several factorsVHSDUDWLRQWHFKQLTXHVchemicals processes like flotation process.One of the methods used in coal beneficiation process is dry method.This method was popular at the beginning of the 20th century.Then it was successfully used in the United States (1919).Separator FrazerYancey was used in USA and it was working as a heavy dense medium (air and sand suspension).
