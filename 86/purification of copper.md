## Laboratory 6.3: Recrystallization: Purify Copper Sulfate
In this lab,we'll use a procedure called recrystallization to purify crude copper sulfate.Crude copper sulfate is a mixture of copper sulfate with various impurities that may include copper carbonate,copper oxides,and other copper compounds.You can obtain crude copper sulfate at a hardware or lawn and garden store,where it is sold as a root killer or for pond treatmentFrom Ore to Finished Product CopperCopper From Beginning to End.Copper is a major metal and an essential element used by man.It is found in ore deposits around the world.It is also the oldest metal known to man and was first discovered and used about 10,000 years ago.And as alloyed in bronze (coppertin alloy) about 3000 BC,was the first engineering material known to man.
