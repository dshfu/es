## Hydrometallurgy Wikipedia
Hydrometallurgy is a method for obtaining metals from their ores.It is a technique within the field of extractive metallurgy involving the use of aqueous chemistry for the recovery of metals from ores,concentrates,and recycled or residual materials.Metal chemical processing techniques that complement hydrometallurgy are pyrometallurgy,vapour metallurgy and molten saltHydrometallurgical considerations in processing arsenicIn any successful hydrometallurgical process treating copperarsenic concentrates,key results would include high copper extraction during leaching and arsenic deportment to a stable residue.As most of these concentrates also contain significant levels of gold and silver,recovery of these precious metals cannot be overlooked.
