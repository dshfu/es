## Underground Mining for Meeting Environmental Concerns A
Underground mining can be considered to be more acceptable than surface mining from environmental and social perspectives since,it often has a smaller footprint than an openpit of comparable capacity.The main advantage of underground mining compared to surface mining is that in general only the ore is extracted and waste rock is left behind.MINING TERMINOLOGY Underground mining and mining machineryIf the excavation used for mining is entirely open or operated from the surface,it is termed a surface mine.If the excavation consists of openings for human entry below the earth's surface,it is called an underground mine.The details of the procedure,layout,and equipment used in the mine distinguish the mining method.
