To construct accurately the pneumatic circuit ii.To report briefly the pneumatic experiments in group.3.0 Theory4.0 Safety Precaution First of all,it is important to mention some safety rules such as : i.Do not start the experiment without the technician or lecturer.ii.Do not using damage equipments.iii.Doubleacting cylinder Indirect controlA doubleacting cylinder is to advance when the left push button is operated.When the right push button is operated the cylinder is to retract.For controlling cylinders at high speed or of large diameter,the air flow required determines that a large size control valve should be used.
