## Copper Mining and Processing: Processing of Copper Ores
Copper processing is a complied process that begins with mining of the ore (less than 1% copper) and ends with sheets of 99.99% pure copper called hodes,which will ultimately be made into products for everyday use.The most common types of ore,copper oxide and copper sulfide,undergo two different processes,hydrometallurgy and pyrometallurgy,respectively,due to the differentsulphide ore extraction process to copper productCopper Smelting Process Furnaces Used,By Products,and Mining for Copper Bearing Ore.There are two categories of copper ore; sulphide ore which is processed.
