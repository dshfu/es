## TOP CAVING Mining Science and Technology
Longwall Topcoal Caving (TCC) is a method of extraction for underground mining of thick seams.It uses a longwall setup and natural forces to aid in the winning of coal.With this method of extraction only a single longwall is developed at the foot of the seam.The control of the roof layers at the face is by means of powered supports.AUSTAR COAL MINE &gt; About Us &gt; Longwall Top Coal CavingMining Operation.Longwall Top Coal Caving is considered ideal for thick seams (&gt;4.5m).the LTCC method allows for up to 80% recovery of additional coal that is usually unable to be mined using conventional longwall extraction.
