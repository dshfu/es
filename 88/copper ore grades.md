## Copper Mining and Processing: Processing of Copper Ores
Copper oxides are more abundant near the surface,but are considered lowgrade ore,with a lower concentration of copper.Although this requires more ore to be extracted and processed,this process is less expensive,so oxides can still be mined at a profit.On the other hand,while copper sulfide ores are less abundant,they contain higherTypes of Copper Deposits in the World Investing News NetworkThe average grade of copper ores in the 21st century is below 0.6 percent copper,with the proportion of ore minerals being less than 2 percent of the total volume of the ore rock.

## Copper Declining copper ore grades AME
The average grade of this ore type increased during 2007 to 2009 as large highergrade mines in Chile and the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) ramped up output.Grades of sulphide ore mined from underground are substantially higher than openpit copper ores,but make up a small proportion of total orePROCESS OPTIMISATION OF MIXED COPPER ORESThe variability of the Kansanshi mixed ore in terms of total copper and acid soluble copper grades has a major impact on the flotation recovery.In March 2011,three Blue Cube MQi (inline mineral quantifier) analysers were installed on the mixed ore flotation feed,concentrate and final tails respectively.

## Copper Statistics and Information usgs.gov
Copper is usually found in nature in association with sulfur.Pure copper metal is generally produced from a multistage process,beginning with the mining and concentrating of lowgrade ores containing copper sulfide minerals,and followed by smelting and electrolytic refining to produce a pure copperCopper ores Danafloat HomeThe largest source of copper is from porphyry ore deposits in which one or a combination of the aforementioned minerals occurs.A typical copper sulphide ore contains various levels of iron sulphide types that generally include pyrite (FeS2) and pyrrhotite (Fe1xS).

Part II: Ore Grades,Waste,and Remediation ! Section II: Ore Grades and Mining The grade of an ore is the concentration of the desired material within the rock.There is more metal (a higher concentration) in higher grade metal ores.Ore grades are often given in percentages or in units of ppm (defined below).Copper Ore Types: Sulfides vs.Oxides Investing News NetworkCopper Ore Types: Sulfides vs.Oxides.However,in some cases lowgrade copper oxide ores can still be economically mined because they can be processed at a lower cost than copper sulfide ores.
