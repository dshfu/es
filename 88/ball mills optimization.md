It is difficult,due to the complexity of ball mills' pulverizing process,to describe it by a precise mathematiced model.A fuzzy control method is presented which combines the following techniques:fusion of multisensor information,recognition of mode of operation,control by fuzzy optimization and control by multimodel fuzzy selfadjusting PID.Ball mills MetsoWith more than 100 years of experience in ball mill technology,Metso's ball mills are designed for long life and minimum maintenance.They grind ores and other materials typically to 35 mesh or finer in a variety of appliions,both in open or closed circuits.
