## Methods of Gold Mining
Gold mining is the process of mining of gold or gold ores from the ground.There are several techniques and processes by which gold may be extracted from the earth.Placer mining Placer mining is the technique by which gold that has accumulated in a placer deposit is extractedRock Crushing methods and How to recover gold from OresHere is a discussion of the procedures to crush Quartz or other minerals and extract the gold from these rich ores.For really large chunks of material,it may be necessary to initially break down the large pieces with hammers.Sometimes heavyduty chisels can also come in handy in this part of the process as one breaks down large chunks into

## Method of Gold Extraction using Borax Small Scale Miners
In Benguet province,a group of miners have been using the mercuryfree gravityborax method (GBM) for gold extraction for decades.This method basically requires the same equipment as the amalgamation methods.However,after the rod milling,an ore concentrate holding the heavy minerals is produced by using a launder (gold sluice) and a gold washing pan.9 Step Process for Discovering,Mining &amp Refining GoldJan 23,2012&nbsp&#0183&#32Gold miners too take special care to make the impact of mining for gold as light as possible.Reclaiming land to its previous natural state is the final and perhaps most important step to ensuring the process of obtaining gold doesn't result in permanent damage to the landscape.

## Smelting and Roasting Ores to recover gold,silver and
Some fairly rich ores require a lot of work to get all the gold and silver out them.Historically,smelting and roasting of ores have been used to capture the gold from difficult to treat ores.Just like those old time miners,we don't want to throw any of the silver or gold away as it can be valuable.Brine mining WikipediaBrine mining is the extraction of useful materials (elements or compounds) which are naturally dissolved in brine.The brine may be seawater,other surface water,or groundwater.It differs from solution mining or insitu leaching in that those methods inject water or chemicals to dissolve materials which are in a solid state in brine mining,the materials are already dissolved.
