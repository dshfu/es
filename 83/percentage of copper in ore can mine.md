The average grade of copper ores in the 21st century is below 0.6 percent copper,with the proportion of ore minerals being less than 2 percent of the total volume of the ore rock.Copper Production: How Is Copper Made? The BalanceThe froth,which contains about 30 percent copper,27 percent iron and 33 percent sulfur,is skimmed off and taken for roasting.If economical,lesser impurities that may be present in the ore,such as molybdenum,lead,gold,and silver,can also be processed
