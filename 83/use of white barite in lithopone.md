An alternative white pigment.Lithopone is a coprecipitated zinc sulfide and barium sulfate combination,which can act as a costeffective alternative for TiO 2.When used to partially replace TiO 2 in some plastic systems,lithopone can help increase extruder yields and reduce processing costs.Plastic formulators using lithopone can also expect an improvement in product quality.Drilling Grade Natural White Barite Lumps,95% NaturalWhy do we us barite baryte in lithopone paint? Barium sulfide is an important chemical made from barite.When it is mixed with zinc sulfate,a chemical reaction ensues that results in an intimate mixture of barium sulfate and zinc sulfide called lithopone,which serves as a white pigment.
