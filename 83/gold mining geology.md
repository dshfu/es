GEOLOGY AND RESOURCES OF GOLD IN THE UNITED STATES Introduction to Geology and Resources of Gold,and Geochemistry of Gold The Case for Gold An Introduction to Geology and Resources of Gold in the United States By Daniel R.Shawe Abstract Gold has long been a store of wealth,whether held by governments or in private hoards.The Geology Of Gold Recreational Gold ProspectingGold is relatively scarce in the earth,but it occurs in many different kinds of rocks and in many different geological environments.Though scarce,gold is concentrated by geologic processes to form commercial deposits of two principal types: lode (primary) deposits and placer (secondary) deposits.

## Gold in California: California Gold,Geology &amp Prospecting
C alifornia's rich gold mining heritage should not end with 'historical' mining: the State's geology and mining history supports that rich deposits remain to be found,and many deposits that were mined left unexplored resources in place.But the naivety of the public and green movements,overregulation by bureaucracies,costs and liabilities of mining,and exploration costs have left theEight Natural Geologic Signs Pointing Toward GoldBy Chris Ralph: Sometimes I get asked,"What should I look for when metal detecting that will tell me there is gold present in the ground?" I always respond that I wish there was a simple,easy answer.The problem is that gold occurs in many types of deposits,and what indiors work great for one type of deposit don't always work well for another.
