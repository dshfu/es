## Mine Tailings Ground Truth Trekking
Mine tailings are the ore waste of mines,and are typically a mudlike material.Worldwide,the storage and handling of tailings is a major environmental issue.Many tailings are toxic and must be kept perpetualy isolated from the environment.Scale of tailings production is immense,since metal extraction is usually only ounces or pounds,forBarrick Gold Corporation Sustainability EnvironmentMining involves the removal and processing of oreâ€”the rock containing economically recoverable amounts of desired metals.To access the ore deposits,waste rock must be removed and stored in waste rock dumps,and after processing,mine tailings may be produced and stored in engineered tailings storage facilities (TSFs).
