## How Does Granite Change Into Sandstone? Reference
Gneiss is a metamorphic rock,granite is an igneous rock and sandstone is a sedimentary rock.These rocks primarily consist of quartz,feldspar and mica.All rocks undergo a series of processes called the rock cycle,where one type of rock changes into another.The mineral constituents that create these rocks get recycled over time.GraniteSandstone BHM Granite &amp Marble South Africa20191123&ensp&#0183&enspSandstone is a clastic sedimentary rock composed mainly of sandsized (0.0625 to 2 mm) mineral particles or rock fragments.Most sandstone is composed of quartz or feldspar (both silies) because they are the most resistant minerals to weathering processes at the Earth's surface,as seen in Bowen's reaction series.
