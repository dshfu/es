## Cement Standards and Concrete Standards
ASTM cement standards and concrete standards contain specifiions and test methods to determine the properties of concrete,hydraulic cements,and aggregates.These ingredients are mixed with water to create concrete which is used as a primary construction material in buildings.These cement and concrete standards allow laboratories allReady Mix Concrete Ordering TipsJan 24,2019&nbsp&#0183&#32One of the most important factors before ordering readymix concrete is knowing the required compressive strength.Typically,reinforced concrete ranging between 3,500 to 4,000 psi is used on footing and slabs on grade between 3,500 to 5,000 psi on suspended slabs,beams and girders and walls and columns normally require between 3,000 to 5,000 psi.

## Concrete Wikipedia
Concrete,usually Portland cement concrete,is a composite material composed of fine and coarse aggregate bonded together with a fluid cement (cement paste) that hardens over time—most frequently a limebased cement binder,such as Portland cement,but sometimes with other hydraulic cements,such as a calcium aluminate cement.It is distinguished from other,noncementitious types of concrete
