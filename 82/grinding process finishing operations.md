## What is the Lapping and Define the Process Lapmaster
The term &quotlapping&quot is used to describe a number of various surface finishing operations where loose abrasive powders are used as the grinding agent at normally low speeds.It is a process reserved for products that demand very tight tolerances of flatness,parallelism,thickness orSuperfinishing Wikipedia2019116&ensp&#0183&enspSuperfinishing,also known as micromachining,microfinishing,and shortstroke honing,is a metalworking process that improves surface finish and workpiece geometry.This is achieved by removing just the thin amorphous surface layer left by the last process with an abrasive stone or tape this layer is usually about 1 μm in magnitude.Superfinishing,unlike polishing which produces a mirror
