## Aggregates cement
Coarse aggregates are any particles greater than 0.19 inch,but generally range between 3 8 and 1.5 inches in diameter.Gravels constitute the majority of coarse aggregate used in concrete with crushed stone making up most of the remainder.Natural gravel and sand are usually dug or dredged from a pit,river,lake,or seabed.ASTM C33 C33M 18 Standard Specifiion for ConcreteC535 Test Method for Resistance to Degradation of LargeSize Coarse Aggregate by Abrasion and Impact in the Los Angeles Machine.ASTM C33 C33M18,Standard Specifiion for Concrete Aggregates,ASTM International,West Conshohocken,PA,2018,
